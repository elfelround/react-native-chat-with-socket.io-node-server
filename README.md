app works, server works, i recommend expo to test it

i am dropping this server and starting a new one, socket.io documentation sucks

to run server, read the commands.txt it has a lot of useful info, to run front either compile or start a project with expo like i did myself and export to Virtualized/real device

the code is commented to extreme so you shouldnt have any trouble understanding it

peace out
